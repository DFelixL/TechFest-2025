TECHFEST Data Analytics Competition is a national-level competition organized by HIMTI Universitas Bina Nusantara as part of TECHFEST 2025. The competition challenges undergraduate students across Indonesia to solve real-world public policy problems using data-driven approaches.

This project focuses on analyzing government-related datasets to extract meaningful insights that can support evidence-based public policy decisions. Participants were required to conduct in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables, and present findings through structured visualizations and analytical storytelling.

The objective was not only to build visual dashboards but to construct logical hypotheses, validate them with data, and translate analytical findings into actionable policy insights.
